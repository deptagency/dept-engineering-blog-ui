# DEPT® Engineering Blog UI

## 🏁 Getting Started

If you are a DEPT Engineer, ask a DEPT® team memember for environment variables. Otherwise please see the template repository for information on how to connect this project to your Ghost instance. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deptagency/dept-engineering-blog-ui
cd dept-engineering-blog-ui
yarn

# Development
yarn dev

# Production
yarn build
```

## Previewing Posts

Clicking on the `Preview` button on an unpublished post in the Ghost Admin UI will show you the post in the default Ghost theme along with a URL where you can preview the post in isolation (this url will end in `/p/[hash-of-characters]`). You can view it in our DEPT® Theme if you replace the supplied URL's domain with the Engineering blogs, so that the URL reads `https://engineering.deptagency.com/p/[hash-of-characters]`


## Unsuported Ghost Admin functionality

Not all fields and settings in the Ghost Admin UI are available in our theme. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- Custom scripts in the header and footer of a Blog Post


## 🤯 Ensure headless mode of Ghost CMS

For best SEO results it is strongly recommended to disable the default Ghost Handlebars theme front-end by selecting the _Make this site private_ flag within your Ghost admin settings.
